Proof reading everything won't hurt, but there are some important stuffs to be looked over.

System Requirements doc: 3.2.2
-postcondition looks like '????' (didn't know better, srry)
-behavior sends the reader to the other doc for state and activity diagram (not sure if ok)


Analysis Design doc:
11. Competing software: it's a straight up lie "none (software) doing the exact same thing". Well there is, but should we really tell her?
10. Technically with all pictures i could arrange it nicely. This way is ugh.
9.  Operation mode: there's alot of --insert picture-- of supposed pictures of the actual program we don't have. Leave it? Improvise?
p.s. the last one contains "woopty freaking doo", must not submit it like that :)
p.p.s the subchapter starts with ......, the beginning didn't seem good enough. If you don't have a better idea just delete them.
7.  Has some wikipedia copy paste but honestly idk if she minds.
8. Respected git's ordering since i didn't make a numbered list so she couldn't see they aren't 13 >:(
2. Jumping from model/pattern to algorithm is kinda weird, maybe the section should have been more like x number of classes
which do this and that and inheritances and oop and honestly idk i did all i could forgive me senpai :|
4. Read the 2nd paragraph. Laugh.
